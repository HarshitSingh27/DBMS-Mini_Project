# Agriculture Management System

The main aim of developing the “Agriculture-Vendor Management System
Project” application is to help farmers by providing all kinds of agriculture related
information on the site. This is a web application which helps farmers to share
best practice farming processes. It helps farmers to improve their productivity and
profitability. It enables farmers to sell their products online and Buyers can
purchase tools and seeds directly from sellers. Farmers can view their profile and
they can register, edit and delete data.

The farmers can sell their productions online and the buyer can purchase various
agricultural products online. Buyer can send purchase request to check the quality
of the Agro product through mails

We plan to achieve this by using HTML,CSS and Javascript for frontend along with
MYSQL,PHP and XAMPP for the backend and Database
